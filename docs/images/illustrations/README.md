# Illustrations and Animations
The illustrations where created with https://www.draw.io/
The .drawio files can be reopened in draw.io and be used to redo/adapt the illustrations.
The animations where created with http://gifmaker.org/. As a rule of thumb, every end-state and dead-end has a delay of 2000ms, 
all others use a delay of 500ms. When going back and forth in the DOM tree, the turn point will have a delay of 1000ms.
