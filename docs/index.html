                <p>Imitation is a key process when learning new concepts. ScalaWebTests own integration tests are there to provide a great example on how to structure and build your integration tests.</p>

                <h3>Simple Gauges</h3>
                <p>Gauges or templates are used in manufacturing to quickly verify a workpiece. If it fits the gauge, it fulfills the requirements.
                An essential part of this concept is, not to verify what doesn't matter and only to verify for the needed precision, not more.</p>
