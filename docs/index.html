                <h3>Simple Gauges</h3>
                <p>Gauges or templates are used in manufacturing to quickly verify a workpiece. If it fits the gauge, it fulfills the requirements.
                An essential part of this concept is, to only verify what's needed and with the needed precision.</p>
