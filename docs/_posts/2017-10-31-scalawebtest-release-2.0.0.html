        <header><h3>Update from ScalaWebTest <= 1.1.1</h3></header>
        <p>
            The version bump to 2.0.0 isn't because of big changes, but because we start to use semantic versioning. More on this topic in the release highlights.
        </p>
        <p>
            We updated most of our dependencies and suggest you update them in your project as well, in case you manage any of our transitive dependencies explicitly in your project.
            If you build your project with maven, we suggest you use our bill-of-materials, which automatically takes care of version updates of our dependencies. See <a href="/download.html#maven">Add ScalaWebTest to your maven project</a>
            If you build your project with sbt, we suggest you copy our most important transitive dependencies from the <a href="/download.html#sbt">Add ScalaWebTest to your sbt project</a> section.

        <p>As of release 2.0.0 ScalaWebTest is committed to use semantic versioning as described in <a href="http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html</a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
                <li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and</li>
                <li>PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            A version bump to 2.0.0 was required to introduce semantic versioning, because version 1.0.4 introduced some incompatible API changes.
            ScalaWebTest now uses <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/migration-manager">MigrationManager</a> to make sure no incompatible changes slip the versioning scheme.

        <header><h3>Using github milestones</h3></header>
        <p>We use github milestones now to bundle all issues, which where solved with a specific version of ScalaWebTest. Release 2.0.0 is our first <a href="https://github.com/unic/ScalaWebTest/milestone/1?closed=1">milestone</a>.</p>

        <header><h3>Consistent behavior between verifying complete documents and part of the DOM</h3></header>
        <p>
            Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/unic/ScalaWebTest/issues/47">Issue 47</a> the behavior of fits and doesntFit, when used to verify parts of the DOM,
            is now consistent with the behavior when verifying complete documents.
