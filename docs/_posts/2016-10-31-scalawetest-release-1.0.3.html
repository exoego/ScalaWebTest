        <p>
            ScalaTest provides a wide variety of testing styles.
            While <i>ScalaWebTest</i> only uses <a href="../documentation.html#teststyles">FlatSpec</a> in its own integration tests,
            it supports all testing styles, which are available from ScalaTest.

        <header><h3>Misfit messages where improved</h3></header>
        <p>
            When a <a href="../documentation.html#gauges">gauge</a> doesn't fit, one or more misfit messages are returned.
            They give you hints where you resource might fit the gauge, after a small change. Imagine you expected a link to contain a certain class and text.
            If this isn't the case <i>ScalaWebTest</i> will for example present you all links which had the correct class, but didn't contain the text you expected.
        </p>

        <header><h3>Documentation was improved</h3></header>
        <p>
            We worked a lot on the documentation. As this is mostly contained on our website, users of all <i>ScalaWebTest</i> versions profit from this.
