        <header><h3>Integration of ScalaTest with Selenium</h3></header>
        <p>
            When using Selenium with ScalaTest using the correct versions of some transitive dependencies matters.
            ScalaWebTest therefore provides a <a href="../documentation.html#bom">BOM</a> to help you get up and running immediately.

        <p>
            Copying is one of the most efficient way to learn something new. The integration tests in the ScalaWebTest library have two central goals.
            Providing great examples and testing the library functions itself. Therefore you will also find tests in the library,
            which do not necessarily test thing contained in ScalaWebTest, but are common tasks when writing integration tests.

        <p>
            ScalaWebTest gives you the ability to write <a href="../documentation.html#gauges">gauges</a>. Which can test whether a certain web resource <i>fits</i>
            the defined <a href="../documentation.html#gauges">gauge</a>.
