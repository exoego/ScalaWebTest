        <p>
            With <a href="https://github.com/unic/ScalaWebTest/issues/98">#98</a> we fixed a bug, where the HTML
            fragment, after parsing with Jsoup, would miss the top-level element, if this required a certain parent,
            which is not part of the parsed fragment.
            For example &lt;tr&gt; is only valid within a &lt;tbody&gt;. As Jsoup removes invalid elements during parsing, the &lt;tr&gt; would be missig in the tree, returned by Jsoup.
            To prevent this we now provide an according context to Jsoup, if needed.

        <header><h3>BOM was improved</h3></header>
        <p>
            The Bill-of-Materials, which can be <code>imported</code> in the <code>dependencyManagement</code> of your maven build, was improved.
            We added <code>&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;</code> to all dependencies. Additionally we added <code>play-json</code> to the BOM.
