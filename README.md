# ScalaWebTest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unic/ScalaWebTest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unic/ScalaWebTest)
ScalaWebTest is a library for writing ScalaTest/Selenium based integration tests for websites. It helps you with your basic setup and provides a new and very efficient approach to testing.

In manufacturing it is common to use gauges (also called checking gauges or testing gauges) to verify whether a workpiece meets predefined criteria and tolerances. ScalaWebTest transfers this concept to the world of web integration testing. You can define a gauge in HTML, and use it to verify your web application. This greatly improves the readability, simplicity of your integration tests.
